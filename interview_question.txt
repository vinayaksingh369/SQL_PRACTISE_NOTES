âœ… SQL Interview Preparation Format
ðŸ“Œ Section 1: Basic SQL (Entry-Level Jobs)
Learn the fundamentalsâ€”ideal for freshers and junior roles.

1. What is SQL?
Answer:
SQL (Structured Query Language) is used to interact with relational databases. It allows you to create, read, update, and delete data.

2. What is the difference between WHERE and HAVING?
Answer:

WHERE filters rows before grouping.

HAVING filters groups after grouping.
Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT department, COUNT(*)  
FROM employees  
GROUP BY department  
HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
3. What is a Primary Key?
Answer:
A column (or set of columns) that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It cannot be NULL and must be unique.

4. What is the use of JOIN in SQL?
Answer:
JOIN is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

INNER JOIN: Matching records in both tables.

LEFT JOIN: All records from the left table, matching from the right.

RIGHT JOIN: All from the right, matching from the left.

FULL JOIN: All records when there is a match in one of the tables.

ðŸ“Œ Section 2: Intermediate SQL (Mid-Level Jobs)
Prepares you for analyst roles, backend engineers, etc.

5. What is the difference between RANK(), DENSE_RANK() and ROW_NUMBER()?
Answer:

ROW_NUMBER(): Gives unique sequence numbers.

RANK(): Skips numbers for ties.

DENSE_RANK(): No skips in ranks.

Example:

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name, salary, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY salary DESC)  
FROM employees;
6. How do you find the second highest salary?
Answer 1: Using LIMIT and OFFSET (MySQL)

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT DISTINCT salary  
FROM employees  
ORDER BY salary DESC  
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
Answer 2: Using Subquery

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT MAX(salary)  
FROM employees  
WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees);
7. What is normalization? Name its types.
Answer:
Normalization is organizing data to reduce redundancy.

1NF â€“ Atomic columns.

2NF â€“ Remove partial dependency.

3NF â€“ Remove transitive dependency.

ðŸ“Œ Section 3: Advanced SQL (High-Paying Jobs)
For data engineers, data scientists, senior developers.

8. What are CTEs (Common Table Expressions)?
Answer:
A CTE allows temporary result sets that can be referred to within a SELECT, INSERT, or UPDATE.

sql
Copy
Edit
WITH top_employees AS (
  SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 100000
)
SELECT * FROM top_employees;
9. Explain Window Functions with an example.
Answer:
Window functions perform a calculation across a set of rows related to the current row.

sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT name, salary,  
       AVG(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department) AS avg_salary  
FROM employees;
10. What is a Deadlock in SQL?
Answer:
A deadlock occurs when two or more transactions hold locks and wait for each other to release locks. SQL Server handles it by terminating one of the transactions.

11. How would you optimize a slow SQL query?
Answer:

Use indexes.

Avoid SELECT *.

Use proper WHERE conditions.

Avoid correlated subqueries if not needed.

Check execution plans.

ðŸ“š Final Tips to Crack SQL Interviews
Practice 20-30 SQL problems daily on platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, or StrataScratch.

Use real datasets from Kaggle or mock company scenarios.

Always explain why you're writing a query a certain way in interviews.

Be clear with set theory, null handling, and date/time functions.
